In last week's class, we learned simple join. Sometimes, for some of the rows you are joining, you may not be able to find matching records in another table. In that case, you still want to keep the records from one table after JOIN. In this challenge, we will learn how to do that. 

For your reference, the figure below shows different types of joins and how to run the query for each type.

## Get a random sample from the Facebook dataset

Run the code below to create a SQLite database that contains a random sample of the Facebook data we used in week 9.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(DBI)
# create database: this will create a file on our hard drive
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/facebook-db-mini.sqlite")
# reading the first file
congress <- read.csv("data/congress-facebook-2017.csv",
	stringsAsFactors=F)

# this determines the seed in the pseudo-random number generator
# to guarantee that you always get the same results
# it's good for replicability
set.seed(20191212)
# sample 100 rows randomly
congress <- congress[sample(nrow(congress), 100), ]
# adding first table: user-level data
dbWriteTable(db, "congress", congress)
# testing that it works with a simple query
dbListFields(db, "congress")
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM congress LIMIT 5')
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
fls <- list.files("data/posts", full.names=TRUE)
set.seed(20191212)

for (f in fls){
  
  message(f)
  # read file into memory
  fb <- read.csv(f, stringsAsFactors=F)
  # sample 5 percent of rows randomly
  fb <- fb[sample(nrow(fb), size = nrow(fb)/20), ]
  
  # adding to table in SQL database
  dbWriteTable(db, "posts", fb, append=TRUE)
  
}
# testing that it works
dbListFields(db, "posts")
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 5')
# what if we make a mistake and want to remove the table?
# dbRemoveTable(db, "posts")
# and we close the connection for now
dbDisconnect(db)
```

## Questions

1. Connect to the database we just created. How many rows are there in each table?

```{r}
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/facebook-db-mini.sqlite")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts")

dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM congress")
```

2. How many rows do you get when use `JOIN` to join posts with congress? What kind of join is this? What does this tell us about the data we have?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM congress AS c
  JOIN posts AS p
  ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
")
# There are missing entries either for the posts authors, or for the congress members' posts, or both.
# However, this query cannot tell us exactly how many are missing from either tables.
```

3. How many members of congress do not have any posts?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM congress AS c
  LEFT JOIN posts AS p
  ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
  WHERE p.screen_name IS NULL
")
```

4. How many authors of posts cannot be matched to the members of congress we have in the database?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.screen_name) FROM congress AS c
  RIGHT JOIN posts AS p
  ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
  WHERE c.screen_name IS NULL
")
```

5. What would you do to create a table that is equivalent to the result of a FULL OUTER JOIN? Hint: look up UNION ALL. 

```{r}
# Use LEFT JOIN for posts on congress and UNION ALL with LEFT JOIN for congress on posts where posts are missing
dbGetQuery(db, 
  "SELECT c.*, p.* FROM posts AS p
  LEFT JOIN congress AS c
  ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
  UNION ALL
  SELECT c.*, p.* FROM congress AS c
  LEFT JOIN posts AS p
  ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
  WHERE p.screen_name IS NULL
  LIMIT 20
")
```

```{r}
dbDisconnect(db)
```
